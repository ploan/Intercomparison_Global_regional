This folder includes all codes for Alexander et al. (2025) "Less intense daily precipitation maxima in regional compared to global gridded products" - Journal of Climate
The list of figures includes: 
1. Figure 1: Map of IPCC-AR6 subregions in the studies
2. Figure 2: Map plots of (a) the climatology (2001–2016) of the annual wettest day (Rx1day, in mm) derived from the regional in situ dataset over a continent, used as a reference, and (b)–(o) the differences (in mm) between various datasets from the FROGS (Roca et al., 2019) global database minus the reference dataset
3. Figure 3. Inter-product spread among time series of the spatially-weighted average of the annual wettest day (Rx1day; in mm) over different sub-regions of a continent as defined in the Sixth IPCC Assessment Report (AR6) and shown in Figure 1. Datasets from the FROGS (Roca et al., 2019) global database are used in addition to a regional in situ dataset
4. Figure 4. Summary global maps for sub-regions
5. Figure 5. Trend plots for sub-regions
6. Figure 6. Similarity in the Timing of extremes across different sub-regions
